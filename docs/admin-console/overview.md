title: Thabala Admin Console Overview

Thabala provides a web interface to manage your Thabala account securely in a web browser.

Using the web interface you can start/pause/delete service instances, can see logs, monitor metrics or scale up/down.
Using the web interface you also can create users, set permissions, authenticators and can allocate them
to certain service instances with the required permissions.

Everything that can be done in the Web Admin Console can be done
programmatically by the Thabala CLI. To manage your account programmatically
and as Infrastructure as Code use the [Thabala Command Line Interface](/cli).
See the [Infrastructure as Code](/admin-console/iac) section for further details.
