Internal Thabala Authenticator is a username/password based authentication method
where he password hashes stored encrypted in the Thabala backend database. This is a secure
enough mechanism but it's recommended to use [OAuth2 over HTTPS](/admin-console/security/oauth2)
with one of the supported Identity Providers (Google, GitHub, Okta, ...) whenever it's possible.
